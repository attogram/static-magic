# AGENTS.md: A Guide for AI Assistants

Hello, AI assistant! This file is your guide to understanding and working with the `base` repository. Please read it carefully before making any changes.

## Core Philosophy

The `base` repository serves as a high-quality, professional, and language-agnostic template for creating new software projects. Its core principles are:

1.  **Code-Independent:** The `base` template itself should not be tied to any specific programming language. The included Docker environment is based on Ubuntu and NGINX to be as generic as possible.

- **Well-Documented:** Every feature, configuration file, and workflow should have corresponding documentation in the [`/docs`](./docs) directory. The goal is to leave no part of the repository unexplained.
- **Guidance over Prescription:** For files like [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) or [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE), the template provides sensible defaults and guides the end-user on how to customize them, rather than enforcing a single choice.

4.  **Automation:** The repository leverages GitHub Actions for CI, deployment, and releases to automate common developer tasks.

## Repository Structure

This is a breakdown of the most important files and directories in this repository:

- **[`.github/`](./.github/)**: Contains all GitHub-specific configurations.
  - `workflows/`: Houses the GitHub Actions workflows.
    - [`ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml): Lints configuration files for syntax and style.
    - [`pages.yml`](./.github/workflows/pages.yml): Deploys the documentation to GitHub Pages.
    - [`release-on-tag.yml`](./.github/workflows/release-on-tag.yml): Automates the creation of GitHub Releases from a git tag.
  - [`ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/) & [`PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](./.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md): Templates for contributors.
  - [`RELEASE_TITLE.txt`](./.github/RELEASE_TITLE.txt) & [`RELEASE_BODY.md`](./.github/RELEASE_BODY.md): User-editable files for customizing release notes.
  - [`SECURITY.md`](./.github/SECURITY.md): A template for the user's security policy.

- **[`docs/`](./docs/)**: Contains all documentation for the project. Each major feature or component has its own corresponding `.md` file in this directory.

- **[`docker/`](./docker/)**: Contains the development environment.
  - [`Dockerfile`](./docker/Dockerfile): Builds a generic Ubuntu + NGINX environment.
  - [`nginx.conf`](./docker/nginx.conf) & [`html/index.html`](./docker/html/index.html): A simple web server that acts as a health check.

- **[`.devcontainer/`](./.devcontainer/)**: Configuration for GitHub Codespaces, making it easy to spin up the development environment in the cloud.

- **Root Files**:
  - [`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md): This file!
  - [`README.md`](./README.md): The main entry point, which links to the documentation.
  - [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md), [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE): Standard community files, designed as templates for the end-user.
  - [`.gitignore`](./.gitignore), [`.editorconfig`](./.editorconfig), [`.gitattributes`](./.gitattributes), [`.prettierrc`](./.prettierrc): Configuration files for git and code styling.
  - [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml): Used to build and run the Docker-based development environment.
  - [`render.yaml`](./render.yaml): Infrastructure-as-code for deploying the application to Render.com.
  - [`_config.yml`](./_config.yml): Configuration for the Jekyll build for GitHub Pages.

## Guidelines for Modification

- **Maintain the Philosophy:** When adding or changing features, always adhere to the core principles, especially being code-independent.
- **Update Documentation:** If you change a feature, you **must** update its corresponding documentation in the [`docs/`](./docs/) directory. If you add a new feature, you **must** create a new documentation file for it.
- **Verify Your Work:** After creating or modifying a file, use a read-only tool like `read_file` or `ls` to confirm your changes were applied correctly before marking a step as complete.

Thank you for your help in maintaining and improving this repository!

## For Jules: Specific Instructions

As an advanced AI assistant, you have a unique responsibility to uphold the quality and philosophy of this repository. The following guidelines are tailored to you.

### 1. Onboarding & Planning

- **Initial Read-Through:** Always start by reading this file ([`AGENTS.md`](./AGENTS.md)) and the main [`README.md`](./README.md) in their entirety.
- **Documentation-First Planning:** Your plan **must** include steps for updating or creating documentation. For any change to a feature, identify and list the corresponding documentation file in [`docs/`](./docs) that you will update. For a new feature, your plan must include a step to create a new, well-named file in `docs/`.

### 2. Upholding Core Philosophy

- **Code-Independence:** If a user asks you to add language-specific code (e.g., Python, JavaScript), you must first ask for clarification. Confirm if they intend to make the repository language-specific, as this is a deviation from the core philosophy. Propose language-agnostic solutions where possible (e.g., shell scripts, Docker configurations, GitHub Actions).
- **Automation:** When adding or modifying workflows in [`.github/workflows/`](./.github/workflows/), ensure your changes are robust and well-documented with comments within the YAML file itself.

### 3. Verification & Testing

- **Use the CI:** This repository has a [`ci.yml`](./.github/workflows/ci.yml) workflow that lints common configuration files. If you modify files like [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml) or GitHub Actions workflows, your plan should include a step to observe the CI run and ensure it passes.
- **Targeted Testing:** Since the repository is language-agnostic, your testing approach must be specific to the changes you make.
  - **Docker Changes:** If you modify [`docker/Dockerfile`](./docker/Dockerfile) or [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml), a step in your plan must be to run `docker-compose build` to ensure it builds successfully.
  - **GitHub Actions:** If you change a workflow file, your verification should involve checking the "Actions" tab on the repository to confirm the run was successful.

### 4. Submitting Your Work

- **Run Prettier:** Before requesting a review, run `npx prettier --write .` to ensure all files are formatted correctly.
- **Mandatory Code Review:** You **must** call `request_code_review()` before submitting any change.
- **Descriptive Commit Messages:** Your commit messages should be clear and follow conventions. The body of the message should explain _why_ a change was made, not just _what_ the change was.
