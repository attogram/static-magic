          <h2>What is Markdown?</h2>
          <p>
            Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting
            syntax. Its main goal is to be as readable as possible, even in its
            raw form. It's a simple way to write and format articles,
            documentation, and messages.
          </p>
          <pre><code># This is a heading

This is a paragraph with some **bold** and *italic* text.

- This is a list item.
- So is this.</code></pre>

          <h2>Why Use Markdown on a Static Site?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Simplicity:</strong> It's much easier and faster to write
              content in Markdown than in raw HTML.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Portability:</strong> Markdown files are just plain text,
              so they can be opened and edited by any text editor.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>GitHub Native:</strong> GitHub renders Markdown files
              automatically, making it the standard for READMEs and
              documentation in repositories.
            </li>

          <h2>Live Conversion</h2>
          <p>
            As you've seen on our
            <a href="/features/markdown-converter.html">Markdown Converter</a>
            page, you can use a JavaScript library to convert Markdown to HTML
            directly in the browser. This means you can write your content in
            simple <code>.md</code> files and then use a script to fetch and
            render them on your site, creating a very simple Content Management
            System (CMS) without a backend.
