# Standard Repository Files

This document explains the purpose of the standard, language-agnostic configuration files included in this repository.

## [`.gitignore`](../.gitignore)

This file tells the `git` version control system which files and directories to ignore. The one included in this repository is pre-populated with common ignores for operating system files (like `.DS_Store` on macOS) and IDE configuration folders (like `.vscode`).

## [`.editorconfig`](../.editorconfig)

This file helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs. The included file sets basic standards like using spaces for indentation and trimming trailing whitespace.

## [`.gitattributes`](../.gitattributes)

This file is used to define attributes per path. The included file has a single, important rule: `* text=auto eol=lf`. This enforces consistent line endings (LF) for all text files, which prevents common issues when developers use different operating systems.

## [`.prettierrc`](../.prettierrc)

This file configures the [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) code formatter. Prettier is used in the [`ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) workflow to ensure that all Markdown and YAML files in the repository have a consistent style.
