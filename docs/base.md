# The `base` Philosophy

Welcome to `base`. This repository is designed to be a robust, professional, and well-documented starting point for new software projects.

## Core Principles

The development of this template is guided by a few core principles:

1.  **Code-Independent:** The template should not be tied to a specific programming language. The goal is to provide a solid foundation of repository structure, CI/CD, and best practices that can be adapted to any language or framework.

2.  **Well-Documented:** Every component, workflow, and configuration file is documented in the [`docs`](./) directory. The goal is to make the repository easy to understand and modify.

3.  **Guidance Over Prescription:** The template provides sensible defaults and placeholder files that guide the user on how to create their own project-specific content, such as contributing guidelines or a license.

4.  **Automation:** The template includes automated workflows for common tasks like linting, testing, and creating releases, helping to ensure code quality and streamline the development process.
