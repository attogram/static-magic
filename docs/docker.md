# Docker-based Development Environment

This repository includes a Docker-based development environment to ensure a consistent and reproducible setup for all contributors.

## Components

The environment is defined by several files:

- **[`docker/Dockerfile`](../docker/Dockerfile)**: This is the blueprint for our development image. It starts from a standard Ubuntu 22.04 base, then installs NGINX and a set of common, language-agnostic development tools (`git`, `curl`, `build-essential`, etc.).
- **[`docker/nginx.conf`](../docker/nginx.conf)**: This is a standard configuration file for the NGINX web server. It's set up to serve the content of the `docker/html` directory.
- **[`docker/html/index.html`](../docker/html/index.html)**: This simple file contains the word `pong` and is served by NGINX. It provides a simple way to check if the environment is running correctly (a "health check").
- **[`docker-compose.yml`](../docker-compose.yml)**: This file makes it easy to build and run the development environment. It defines a single service named `dev` and maps port 80 inside the container to port 8080 on your local machine.
- **[`.dockerignore`](../.dockerignore)**: This file tells Docker which files and directories to exclude from the build context, which helps to speed up the image build process.

## Getting Started

To use the development environment, you must have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your system.

1.  **Build and Run the Container:**
    Open a terminal in the root of the repository and run the following command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

    This will build the Docker image (if it's the first time) and start the container in the background.

2.  **Verify It's Running:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`. You should see the word `pong`.

3.  **Access the Environment:**
    To open a shell inside the running container, use the following command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose exec dev /bin/bash
    ```

    You will now be inside the Ubuntu environment, where you can install any language-specific tools (like Python, Node.js, etc.) and run your code.

4.  **Stopping the Environment:**
    To stop the container, run:
    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

## Extending the Environment

You can easily extend this environment by modifying the [`docker/Dockerfile`](../docker/Dockerfile). For example, to install Python, you could add the following line:

```Dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip
```
