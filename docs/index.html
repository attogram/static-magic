          <p>
            This website is dedicated to showcasing the power of static
            websites, particularly those hosted on GitHub Pages. Many developers
            believe that a "static" site means a non-interactive, boring page.
            We're here to prove that wrong!
          </p>
          <p>
            With just HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, you can create rich,
            interactive, and useful web applications without any backend servers
            or complex build tools. This site is a living demonstration of that
            philosophy.
