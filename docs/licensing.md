# Licensing Information

This repository is distributed under the MIT License, the full text of which is available in the [`LICENSE`](../LICENSE) file.

## What is the MIT License?

The MIT License is a permissive free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). In simple terms, it allows you to do almost anything you want with the code, including using it in proprietary software, as long as you include the original copyright and license notice in any copy of the software.

## How to Use the `LICENSE` File

The included [`LICENSE`](../LICENSE) file contains a copyright line for the `base` template itself:

`Copyright (c) 2025 Attogram Project`

When you create your own project from this template, you should **add your own copyright notice** on a new line directly below the existing one. Do not remove the original line.

For example:

```
Copyright (c) 2025 Attogram Project
Copyright (c) [Your Year] [Your Name or Company]
```

This ensures that attribution is preserved while allowing you to claim copyright on your own modifications and additions.

### Can I Choose a Different License?

Yes. You are free to delete the contents of the `LICENSE` file and replace it with a different license of your choice. However, be aware that this may affect how others can use your project. The [Choose a License](https://choosealicense.com/) website from GitHub is an excellent resource for understanding and selecting a software license.
