# GitHub Pages Site

This repository is configured to use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host a simple, clean website for the project.

## Initial Setup

Before the workflow can deploy your site, you must configure your repository to use GitHub Actions for GitHub Pages. This is a one-time setup step that connects your repository's Pages settings to the `pages.yml` workflow included in this template.

1.  **Navigate to Repository Settings:** Go to the main page of your repository and click on the **Settings** tab.
2.  **Select Pages:** In the left-hand sidebar, click on **Pages**.
3.  **Set the Deployment Source:** Under the "Build and deployment" section, you will see a **Source** option. Select **"GitHub Actions"** from the dropdown menu.

After you select "GitHub Actions", the UI may present you with suggestions for common workflows (e.g., "GitHub Pages Jekyll", "Static HTML"). **You can ignore these suggestions.** This repository already contains a custom, pre-configured workflow ([`.github/workflows/pages.yml`](../.github/workflows/pages.yml)) that will be used automatically.

> **Note:** If you do not perform this setup step, the [`pages.yml`](../.github/workflows/pages.yml) workflow will fail with a "Get Pages site failed" or "HttpError: Not Found" error.

## How It Works

The site is built and deployed by the [`.github/workflows/pages.yml`](../.github/workflows/pages.yml) workflow. Here's a summary of the process:

1.  **Trigger:** The workflow runs automatically on every push to the `main` branch.
2.  **Jekyll Build:** It uses the standard `jekyll-build-pages` GitHub Action to build a static website.
3.  **Homepage:** It is configured to use the root [`README.md`](../README.md) file as the content for the homepage (`index.html`) of the site.
4.  **Styling:** The [`_config.yml`](../_config.yml) file in the root of the repository specifies the `jekyll-theme-primer` theme, which gives the site the standard GitHub look and feel.
5.  **Deployment:** The built static site is then deployed to GitHub Pages.

## Accessing the Site

After the first push to `main`, the site will be available at a URL like:

`https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>/`

You can also find the URL in the "Pages" section of your repository's settings.
