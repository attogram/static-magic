# Code of Conduct

This is a template repository. To adopt a Code of Conduct for your own project, you should replace the contents of this file with a code of conduct that you are willing to enforce.

A popular and widely used option is the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/). You can generate a markdown version of the covenant on their website and paste it into this file.

Remember to update the `[INSERT CONTACT METHOD]` section with a private email address where violations can be reported.
